    [Windows](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)
    
    [MacOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)
    
    [Linux](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux)


    

3.  **Run flutter doctor**

    This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. Check the output carefully for other software you might need to install or further tasks to perform.

    Linux:   https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#update-your-path
    
    
4.  **Platform setup**
  
    Flutter relies on a full installation of Android Studio to supply its Android platform dependencies. However, you can write your Flutter apps in a number of editors

    MacOS:    https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos#platform-setup
    
    Linux:     https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux#android-setup
    
5.  **Set up an editor**
  
    You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with flutter command-line tools. However, we recommend using one of flutter editor plugins for an even better experience. These plugins provide you with code completion, syntax highlighting, widget editing assists, run & debug support, and more.
